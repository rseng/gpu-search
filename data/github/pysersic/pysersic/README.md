docs/source/index.rst:The empirically derived Sérsic profile is the most common parametric form for the surface-brightness profile as it provides a reasonable approximation to nearly all galaxies, given the additional freedom of the Sérsic index over fixed-index profiles. Given the long history of Sérsic fitting codes with many available tools, the development of ``pysersic`` was largely motivated by two related factors, first and foremost of which was the desire to implement Sérsic fitting in a fully Bayesian context at speed. The ability to place the typical Sérsic fitting problem into a Bayesian context with runtimes that are not prohibitive (the traditional drawback of MCMC methods) has recently been unlocked by the second motivation: to leverage the ``jax`` library. ``jax`` utilizes just-in-time compilation to decrease computational runtimes, provides seamless integration with hardware accelerators such as graphics processing units (GPUs) for further improvements in performance, and enables automatic differentiation, facilitating gradient based optimization and sampling methods. Together, these features greatly increase speed and efficiency, especially when sampling or optimizing a large number of parameters.
docs/source/install.rst:Unfortunately jax does not work on windows, so they reccommend utilizing the windows subsystem for linux (WSL) instead. If you are planning on using a GPU or TPU, you must make sure to install the right CUDA version. For more info please refer to the jax `install guide <https://github.com/google/jax#installation>`_. 
README.md:```pysersic``` now requies at least python version 3.9. To start you should have ```jax``` installed. The easiest way to do this is to use ``` pip install 'jax[cpu]' ```, however if you are on windows or planning on running it on a GPU, the installation can be a little more complicated, please see the guide [here](https://github.com/google/jax#installation). The other package dependencies for ```pysersic``` are:
