joss/paper.md:Ongoing work funded by the Italian [National Recovery and Resilience Plan](https://www.mef.gov.it/en/focus/The-National-Recovery-and-Resilience-Plan-NRRP/) is pushing Stingray's performance further with the use of GPUs and parallel computing in anticipation of large-scale astronomical time domain surveys for example with the Vera Rubin Telescope. In addition, the near future will see an overhaul and redesign of Stingray's `modeling` subpackage in order to take advantage of recent developments in fast optimization and sampling algorithms and probabilistic programming. In order to facilitate spectral timing with state-of-the-art instruments, we are actively working to integrate Stingray with ongoing software efforts improving modeling of astronomical spectra.
