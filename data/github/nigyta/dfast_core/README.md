bin/common/rpsbproc_data/cddid.tbl:212538	cd11592	Agmatinase_PAH	Agmatinase-like family includes proclavaminic acid amidinohydrolase. This agmatinase subfamily contains bacterial and fungal/metazoan enzymes, including proclavaminic acid amidinohydrolase (PAH, EC 3.5.3.22) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa guanidinobutyrase (GbuA) and guanidinopropionase (GpuA). PAH hydrolyzes amidinoproclavaminate to yield proclavaminate and urea in clavulanic acid biosynthesis. Clavulanic acid is an effective inhibitor of beta-lactamases and is used in combination with amoxicillin to prevent the beta-lactam rings of the antibiotic from hydrolysis and, thus keeping the antibiotic biologically active. GbuA hydrolyzes 4-guanidinobutyrate (4-GB) into 4-aminobutyrate and urea while GpuA hydrolyzes 3-guanidinopropionate (3-GP) into beta-alanine and urea. Mutation studies show that significant variations in two active site loops in these two enzymes may be important for substrate specificity. This subfamily belongs to the ureohydrolase superfamily, which includes arginase, agmatinase, proclavaminate amidinohydrolase, and formiminoglutamase.	289
bin/common/rpsbproc_data/cddid.tbl:321478	cl01391	Phage_P2_GpU	Phage P2 GpU. This family consists of several bacterial and phage proteins of around 130 residues in length which seem to be related to the bacteriophage P2 GpU protein, which is thought to be involved in tail assembly.	0

bin/common/rpsbproc_data/cddid.tbl:288251	pfam11359	gpUL132	Glycoprotein UL132. Glycoprotein UL132 is a low-abundance structural component of Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV). The function of this protein is not fully understood.	238
bin/common/rpsbproc_data/cddid.tbl:316111	pfam13554	DUF4128	Bacteriophage related domain of unknown function. The three-dimensional structure of NP_888769.1, Structure 2L25, reveals a tail terminator protein gpU fold, which suggests that the protein could have a bacteriophage origin.	128
