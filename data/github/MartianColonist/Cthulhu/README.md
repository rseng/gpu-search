joss/paper.md:We have built `Cthulhu` to provide a user-friendly tool for beginners to learn how to work with the most commonly used line list databases and to readily calculate molecular and atomic cross sections. There are other open source codes that can calculate cross sections, such as HELIOS-K [@Grimm:2015; @Grimm:2021] and ExoCross [@Yurchenko:2018], both of which offer impressive computational performance and are excellent tools for experts to calculate cross sections. However, HELIOS-K requires Nvidia GPUs to run while ExoCross is built in Fortran, both of which can pose accessibility issues for beginners. We offer `Cthulhu`, a pure Python code designed to run on CPUs, as a user-friendly entry point into the world of cross sections for substellar atmospheres.
joss/paper.md:The foremost feature of `Cthulhu` is its ability to straightforwardly compute atomic and molecular cross sections at high speeds (typically > 100,000 lines per second on one CPU). `Cthulhu` calculates cross sections via a generalisation of the Vectorised Voigt method [@Yurchenko:2018], whereby our update to the algorithm uses complex derivatives to perturb a grid of pre-computed template Voigt profiles to the specific properties of each given line [see @MacDonald:2019, Chapter 5, for the mathematical description]. `Cthulhu` is accessible, as it does not require GPUs, can run on a standard laptop, and as a pure Python code it is easy for beginners to install and use. To compute a cross section, a user simply calls `Cthulhu`'s `compute_cross_section` function, specifying the location of the line list, the temperature and pressure, and the wavenumber range. More advanced users can specify custom settings via optional arguments (e.g. Voigt wing cutoffs, intensity cutoffs, or a user-provided pressure broadening file). The documentation and function docstrings explain the various arguments users can provide to `compute_cross_section`. The computed cross section is output by default as a .txt file in the `output` folder on the user's machine, which can be readily used to create an opacity database in a user-preferred format for a specific radiative transfer code. `Cthulhu` also offers utility functions to combine multiple cross section .txt files (e.g. a grid of cross sections for different temperature and pressures for one or more chemical species) into an HDF5 cross section database, as illustrated in our [`quick start`](https://cthulhu.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content/quick_start.html) guide.
