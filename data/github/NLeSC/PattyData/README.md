```console
Documents/SUM_viewer/viewer_sum.tex:The preferences tab looks like Figure \ref{fig-guipref} and it has some visualization options that can be modified. The most important one is the Level of detail. Computers with low visualization resources (without powerful GPU cards) should run with lower Level of detail. Hence, if you experience a non smooth visualization try to decrease the Level of detail.
