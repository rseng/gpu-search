Since, there is no evidence comparing maternal circulating and choriodecidual leukocytes, herein, we characterized their transcriptome and explored the biological processes enriched in choriodecidual leukocytes. From women undergoing spontaneous term labor we isolated circulating and choriodecidual leukocytes, performed microarray analysis (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;5) and qRT-PCR validation (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;9) and interaction network analysis with up-regulated genes. We found 270 genes up-regulated and only 17 genes down-regulated in choriodecidual leukocytes compared to maternal circulating leukocytes. The most up-regulated genes were <italic>CCL18, GPNMB, SEPP1, FN1, RNASE1, SPP1, C1QC</italic>, and <italic>PLTP</italic>. The biological processes enriched in choriodecidual leukocytes were cell migration and regulation of immune response, chemotaxis, and humoral immune responses. Our results show striking differences between the transcriptome of choriodecidual and maternal circulating leukocytes. Choriodecidual leukocytes are enriched in immune mediators implicated in the spontaneous process of labor at term.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer Nature Limited 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Labor is recognized as a physiological process of sterile inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], characterized by the infiltration of immune cells into the cervix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], myometrium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], and maternal-fetal interface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. This interface includes two areas of contact between the mother and the fetus: the decidua parietalis, which lines the uterine cavity not covered by the placenta and is juxtaposed to the chorion laeve; and the decidua basalis, which lays on the basal plate of the placenta and is invaded by the interstitial trophoblast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17"> 17</xref>]. Decidua parietalis is composed of stroma-type cells, glandular cells, and leukocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], and the portion that is attainable is attached to the chorioamniotic membranes; therefore, this anatomical site is known as the choriodecidua [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Since the choriodecidua represents the major site of fetal antigenic exposure to the maternal immune system, our studies have focused on understanding the mechanisms whereby maternal leukocytes are recruited into the maternal-fetal interface and their role in the processes of term and preterm labor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p id="Par3">The current hypothesis is that the chorioamniotic membranes exhibit chemotactic processes driven by specific chemokines in order to recruit maternal circulating leukocytes into the choriodecidua [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. In addition, the responsiveness of peripheral leukocytes to be attracted to chemotactic stimuli derived from the chorioamniotic membranes seems to be a key feature in this process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Consistent with such a hypothesis, previous studies have demonstrated that peripheral leukocytes displayed increased chemotactic activity and cytokine production during the process of labor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], resembling an inflammatory phenotype similar to that observed in pathological conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Collectively, these data suggest that the chorioamniotic membranes, and most likely the decidual stromal cells, recruit maternal circulating leukocytes into the choriodecidua prior to and during the process of labor. Following recruitment, the choriodecidual leukocytes expressed cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] and labor mediators including cytokines/chemokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">, 34</xref>] and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].

However, a direct comparison between the choriodecidual leukocytes and maternal circulating leukocytes during the process of labor at term has not been made. The aims of this study were: (1) to characterize the transcriptome of the choriodecidual leukocytes and maternal circulating leukocytes from the same woman undergoing spontaneous labor at term, and (2) to explore the biological processes enriched in these choriodecidual leukocytes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results and discussion</title><p id="Par5">To our knowledge, this is the first study comparing the transcriptomic signatures of the choriodecidual leukocytes and maternal circulating leukocytes during the process of labor at term.

Overexpression of miR-21 could decrease the apoptosis of neurons by inhibiting the PDCD4/caspase-3 pathway and improve the recovery of locomotor function.</p><p id="Par34">Recently, various studies have reported that many miRNAs are involved in the prognosis of SCI through various pathways, including apoptosis, regeneration, inflammation and demyelination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. It is well known that apoptosis is considered to be a crucial mechanism of cell death in many neurological diseases and SCI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The apoptotic process is associated with numerous genes, and therapeutic strategies might be able to prevent programmed cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In particular, miR-21 has been shown to be an anti-apoptotic factor in many cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], and its expression is significantly upregulated in some CNS diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Our previous study revealed that miR-21 was upregulated 3 days following rat SCI using miRNA microarray [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], and in a study by Oneil [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], miR-21 expression increased significantly at 5 weeks after SCI. However, these studies were both completed in animals and did not reveal whether miR-21 was upregulated in neurons after SCI. Our present study demonstrated that miR-21 was expressed in neurons and was upregulated after rat SCI, but the expression was not specific.</p><p id="Par35">Moreover, it has been shown that miR-21 has protective effects in the injury of different organs. In the injured region after myocardial infarction, miR-21 expression increased and played a protective role [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In addition, miR-21 was able to attenuate the apoptosis of cardiac cells induced by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], and it was involved in ischaemic preconditioning-mediated cardiac protection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Moreover, miR-21 expression was also upregulated after traumatic brain injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. After stroke, the overexpression of miR-21 protected neurons from ischaemia by targeting Fasl [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. In a rat SCI model, when miR-21 was downregulated by antagomir-21, apoptosis increased, and the expression of Fasl and PTEN increased [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In the present study, we found that overexpression of miR-21 decreased neuronal apoptosis and downregulated the expression of PDCD4.</p><p id="Par36">PDCD4 is a pro-apoptotic gene and is able to regulate various aspects of many human diseases as a direct miR-21 target. In cancer, PDCD4 universally acts as a potential target for anticancer therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. In diabetes mellitus, PDCD4 is able to induce the apoptosis of pancreatic &#x003b2;-cells, and this process is controlled by miR-21 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. In heart ischaemia/reperfusion injury, PDCD4 is involved in cardiovascular biology by regulating the apoptosis of cardiac cells and vascular smooth muscle cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Caspases are the final effectors in the apoptotic pathway, and caspase-3 is a major mediator of apoptosis following injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. PDCD4 is thought to at least partly drive apoptosis via the activation of the caspase-3 pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Liu [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] showed that exercise leads to elevated levels of miR-21, which are correlated with changes in PDCD4 expression after SCI. Our experimental data showed that the miR-21/PDCD4/caspase-3 pathway participates in neuronal apoptosis in vitro and following SCI in vivo.</p><p id="Par37">However, there were still some limitations in this study. The ischaemia/reperfusion injury model was established in PC-12 cells, not in primary cultured neurons. When treated with NGF, the PC-12 cells stop dividing and terminally differentiate into neuron-like cells. This makes PC-12 cells useful as a model to study the function and pathophysiology of neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], and such a model has been used in SCI research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. We therefore thought its use was appropriate for this study. In addition, the mechanism of SCI is complex, and miR-21 was not the unique protective element during secondary SCI. Similarly, PDCD4 is not unique as a target gene of miR-21; there are other genes as well.</p><p id="Par38">In summary, in rat SCI models and in the ischaemia/reperfusion injury of PC-12 cells, miR-21 had a protective effect by reducing neuronal apoptosis via the miR-21/PDCD4/caspase-3 pathway. Identifying the roles of miR-21 in neuronal protection might make it a novel therapeutic target for secondary SCI.</p></sec></body><back><ack><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par39">This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 81371956, No. 81171698 and No. 81672174).</p></sec></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contribution</title><p>TZ was responsible for drafting and revising the article and conducting the research.
