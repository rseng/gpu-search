docs/index.rst:XCompact3d is currently able to solve the incompressible and low-Mach number variable density Navier-Stokes equations using sixth-order compact finite-difference schemes with a spectral-like accuracy on a monobloc Cartesian mesh.  It was initially designed in France in the mid-90's for serial processors and later converted to HPC systems based on CPU hardware. **A GPU friendly version of Xcompact3d is currently being developed**.
