```console
CHANGELOG.md:*	Added a new option `--path_to_cutadapt /path/to/cudapt`. Unless this option is specified it is assumed that Cutadapt is in the PATH (equivalent to `--path_to_cutadapt cutadapt`). Also added a test to see if Cutadapt seems to be working before the actual trimming is launched
