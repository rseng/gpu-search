README.md:  At a given point, FANTASIA may raise a warning if your system only has CPUs or the GPU CUDA library version is different than 11.0. You can safely ignore this message as the singularity container is prepared to run on CPUs.
installation_guide_FANTASIA.sh:# 6. GOPredSim can be run using CPUs or GPUs. CPUs is the default option selected in these scripts. However, GPUs can be used to increase the speed when dealing with large amounts of data. In clusters, make sure to select GPU nodes and to load the correspondent CUDA module when launching the pipeline. A sample script for executing the pipeline is included. Paths for execution and conda activation should be double checked.
