```console
hpc/README.md:HyperQueue can automatically detect certain generic resources like CPUs, GPUs and memory. However, this mechanism may not work on all types of hardware. We recommend the much more robust approach of manually specifying resources for HyperQueue workers in `hpc/hq_scripts/allocation_queue.sh`. Please refer to the [HyperQueue documentation](https://it4innovations.github.io/hyperqueue/stable/jobs/resources/) to find out how to manually specify resources.
