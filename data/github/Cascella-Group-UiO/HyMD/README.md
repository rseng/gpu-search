paper.md:Since the hPF scheme was proposed [@Milano:2013], two main codes have been used to perform such simulations. (i) OCCAM [@Zhao:2012], a proprietary Fortran software developed by Milano and co-workers; and (ii) GALAMOST [@Zhu:2013], a CUDA-GPU accelerated C++ code developed by researchers at Jilin University. Unfortunately, neither are open source and freely available to scientists wishing to run hPF simulations of bio- and soft-matter systems.
