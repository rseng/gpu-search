docs/index.rst:It follows a functional programming design by translating circuits into pure functions. This allows qujax to `seamlessly and directly interface with JAX <https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/Common_Gotchas_in_JAX.html#pure-functions>`_, enabling direct access to its powerful automatic differentiation tools, just-in-time compiler, vectorization capabilities, GPU/TPU integration and growing ecosystem of packages.
