```console
vignettes/SequenceSearches.Rmd:Using packages such as `ggExtra` or `ggpubr`, one could even plot marginal histogram or density plots above or below to illustrate any motif positional preference within the sequences. (Though keep in mind that the hit coordinates and sequence lengths would need to be normalized if not all sequences were of the same length, as they are here.)
