paper/bmc_article.bib:abstract = {SUMMARY: SOAP3 is the first short read alignment tool that leverages the multi-processors in a graphic processing unit (GPU) to achieve a drastic improvement in speed. We adapted the compressed full-text index (BWT) used by SOAP2 in view of the advantages and disadvantages of GPU. When tested with millions of Illumina Hiseq 2000 length-100bp reads, SOAP3 takes less than 30 seconds to align a million read pairs onto the human reference genome and is at least 7.5 and 20 times faster than BWA and Bowtie, respectively. For aligning reads with up to 4 mismatches, SOAP3 aligns slightly more reads than BWA and Bowtie; this is because SOAP3, unlike BWA and Bowtie, is not heuristic-based and always reports all answers. AVAILABILITY: SOAP3 is available at: http://www.cs.hku.hk/2bwt-tools/soap3; and http://soap.genomics.org.cn/soap3.html. CONTACT: liruiqiang@gmail.com, twlam@cs.hku.hk.},
