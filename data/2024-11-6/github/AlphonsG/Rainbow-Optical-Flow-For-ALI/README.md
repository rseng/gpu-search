```console
README.md:Rainbow can be installed on Linux, Windows & macOS and supports Python 3.8 and above. We recommend installing and running Rainbow within a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html). Although it is not a requirement, we also recommend installing and running Rainbow on a GPU-enabled system to minimize processing times.
README.md:   For example, Windows users without a GPU (i.e. CPU only) will run:
misc/configs/default_config.yaml:  # cpu or cuda (for gpu)

```
